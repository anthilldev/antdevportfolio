                    My name is Anthony. I grew up loving electronics from a very young age. I would sit at the table hammering away at the 
                    nintendo controller while everyone at awww because i was only 2 years old and getting further than anyone in the mario game In the early 2000's, it was
                    clear. I wanted to do something with computers but at the time, I didnt know what that something would be. I suddenly discovered a youtube video from a young kid
                    that was covering the bash language and how to make a game. I made the game in bash and thought I was going to grow a beared and conquer wessex with my 
                    coding axe (For Viking Fans). Fast forward to 2016 when I finally decided to sit down and actually learn step by step how to build websites which brings 
                    me to today. I finally have my own tech stack and see nothing but smooth sailing from here.
